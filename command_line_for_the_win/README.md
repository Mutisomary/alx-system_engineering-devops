Command line for the win
Project Description
CMD CHALLENGE is a fun and interactive game that tests your Bash skills through a series of command-line tasks. The entire game is played using the command line, and as you progress, the tasks become increasingly challenging, providing an excellent opportunity to improve your command-line abilities.

After completing various tasks take screenshoots.
